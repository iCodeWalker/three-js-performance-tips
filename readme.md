# Three.js Performance Tips:

1. Our goal should be to achieve 60 fps at least.
2. Keep an eye on performance and test across multiple devices, kepp an eye on how heavy is our website.
3. We need to measure the performance, the first thing we need to know is FPS.
   We can use a Javascript FPS meter like stats.js
